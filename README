NAME
    Alt::common::sense::TOBYINK - provides a clean-room reimplementation of
    common::sense

VERSION
    This is Alt::common::sense::TOBYINK 0.001, but it aims at compatibility
    with common::sense 3.73.

SYNOPSIS
       use common::sense;
   
       # your code goes here

DESCRIPTION
    Importing common::sense is roughly equivalent to:

       use utf8;
       use strict qw(vars subs);
       use feature qw(say state switch);
       use feature qw(unicode_strings current_sub fc evalbytes);
       no feature qw(array_base);
       no warnings;
       use warnings qw(FATAL closed threads internal debugging pack
                       portable prototype inplace io pipe unpack malloc
                       deprecated glob digit printf layer
                       reserved taint closure semicolon);
       no warnings qw(exec newline unopened);

    Unfortunately the installation process (and to a lesser extent, the
    implementation) for common::sense is fairly crazy.

    Alt::common::sense::TOBYINK is an Alt implementation of common::sense. To
    use it, continue to `use common::sense` in your code, but to install it,
    do:

       cpanm Alt::common::sense::TOBYINK
